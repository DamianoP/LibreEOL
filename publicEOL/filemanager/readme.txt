======================================================================================================================
INTRODUCTION
======================================================================================================================
Use this application to manage files and directories on your webserver or any FTP server. You can create, rename
and delete directories, upload, download, edit, rename, delete and search files, and change file and directory
permissions*. It's also possible to play audio/video files and view preview thumbnails of images.

FileManager works fine with FTP connections. Please note that if you don't set up an FTP connection in the
configuration, FileManager will use the local file system instead. In this case it can only access directories and
files for which PHP has at least read permission; if you want to upload, edit, rename or delete files, or change
file permissions*, PHP must also have write permission for these files or directories.

FileManager can be used as a stand-alone application, but it's also easy to integrate it into your own website; just
have a look at the USAGE section below and the source code of filemanager.php to see how you can do this.

This software needs PHP 5 or higher.

* On Windows systems changing of file permissions doesn't work properly. This is not a restriction of this software.

======================================================================================================================
FILE SEARCH
======================================================================================================================
You can use FileManager to search files and directories. It will search all directories recursively, starting in
the directory that is currently viewed. At the moment, it is only possible to search for file or directory names.
Wildcards like "*" are not supported; FileManager will find all files and directories containing the search string
in their name. For instance, if you search for "file", the files "filemanager.php", "file.gif", etc. will match
your search.

While FileManager views a search result, file upload is disabled, and you cannot create new directories. If you want
to do so, please return to your current directory listing first. Please note that this is not possible if you disabled
the search function, but told FileManager to start with a search - in this case, the current search result will be
"locked" and file upload and directory creation won't be possible.

======================================================================================================================
USAGE
======================================================================================================================
Extract the files to your webserver and adapt the configuration (config.inc.php) to your needs. You can change
FTP settings and the data directory there and enable or disable file upload/download, renaming, editing, etc.
It's possible to let FileManager automatically replace spaces in filenames with underscores or convert filenames to
lowercase or call a specific URL when uploading or downloading files.

Please make sure that PHP has write permission for FileManager's tmp directory and its sub-folders.

If you want to use FileManager as a stand-alone application, just open filemanager.php with your favorite browser -
that's all, have fun. ;-)

However, if you want to integrate FileManager into your website like I did in the introduction section of
http://www.gerd-tentler.de/tools/filemanager/, please read this little tutorial. It implies however that you have
basic knowledge of PHP programming.

You will need the FileManager class. It should be included at the very beginning of your PHP file, because it will
start a session if there's no session started already. Replace [pathToFileManager] with the directory path where you
installed FileManager:

  <?php
    include_once('[pathToFileManager]/class/FileManager.php');
  ?>
  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
  <html>
  <head>
  ...

Now create an instance and call the create() method anywhere within your PHP file:

  $FileManager = new FileManager();
  print $FileManager->create();

That's it. But wait, there's more. You can also set a data directory - this overrides the settings in
config.inc.php:

  $FileManager = new FileManager('/home/users/gerry/htdocs');
  print $FileManager->create();

By the way, you can create as many instances of the FileManager class as you want, assign different start
directories and change other settings like this:

  $FileManager1 = new FileManager('/home/users/gerry/music');
  $FileManager1->fmView = 'details';
  print $FileManager1->create();

  $FileManager2 = new FileManager('/home/users/gerry/photos');
  $FileManager2->fmView = 'icons';
  print $FileManager2->create();

Please have a look at the config.inc.php file if you want to know which variables are available. All of them can
be modified either in the config file or dynamically at runtime. Please note that while boolean variables in the
config file are set to "yes" or "no", they must be set to "true" or "false" when modified at runtime. Example:

  $FileManager->enableUpload = false;
  $FileManager->hideSystemType = true;

Comma-separated lists can also be defined as array when modified at runtime:

  $FileManager->hideColumns = array('owner', 'group', 'permissions');

Of course all settings must be done *before* the create() function is called!

If you're still not quite sure how to integrate FileManager into your website, just have a look at the source code
of filemanager.php.

======================================================================================================================
USER MANAGEMENT
======================================================================================================================
FileManager does not have a user management, because it is very easy to integrate it into your website and your own
existing user management. But it is possible to set passwords and data directories for several users, if this is all
that you need. Just set the loginPassword variable either in the config file or at runtime like in this example:

  $FileManager = new FileManager();
  $FileManager->loginPassword = array(
    'myPwd1::/home/users/peter/htdocs',
    'myPwd2::/home/users/paul/htdocs',
    'myPwd3::/home/users/mary/htdocs'
  );
  print $FileManager->create();

This works in local mode and in FTP mode.

======================================================================================================================
UPLOAD ENGINES
======================================================================================================================
File upload with PHP has two drawbacks: usually the file size is limited (default is 2 MB per file and 8 MB per POST
request), and it is not possible to view a progress bar - at least not without APC extension (NOTE: you need PHP 5.2+).
The size limit can be changed for instance in the php.ini file by the server administrator, but this will also affect
all other PHP applications. (Changing this value on a per-directory-basis is also possible, see php.net for detailed
information.) For this reason, FileManager comes with several upload engines.

THE JAVA UPLOADER

The open source JUpload applet views a progress bar, supports drag and drop, upload of big files and even whole
directories. It's integrated into FileManager since version 7.8 as default upload engine. Java 1.4 or higher is
required on the client side.

THE JAVASCRIPT UPLOADER

Don't want to use a Java applet? Well, if you don't need to upload big files, you can try the integrated open source
FileDrop uploader, which views a progress bar, supports drag and drop and multiple file upload. It should work with
all browsers that support HTML5. Please note that when uploading several big files at once, the browser may crash -
if this happens, try to upload the files one by one or use another upload engine.

THE PERL UPLOADER

Alternatively FileManager can also upload files via Perl and view a progress bar while uploading. This requires however
that Perl is installed on your server, and that the Perl scripts in FileManager's cgi directory can be executed.

If you want to use the integrated Perl uploader, first make sure that the uploadEngine variable in FileManager's
configuration file is set to "Perl", or set it at runtime (see examples above). If your Apache server reads .htaccess
files and the setting of options is allowed, then no webserver configuration should be necessary. Otherwise, ask your
server administrator to allow script execution in FileManager's cgi directory. Here's an example for Apache servers:

  <Directory "/path/to/filemanager/cgi">
    Options +ExecCGI
  </Directory>

  AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl .prl

Also make sure that the Perl scripts in the cgi directory are saved as ASCII files and that they have proper read and
execute permissions.

THE PHP UPLOADER

This is the basic uploader that should only be used if neither the Java nor the Perl uploader works for you. It only
requires PHP on your server, but you will have to live with a file size limit (depending on your PHP configuration)
and without a progress bar (unless your browser views it by default).

======================================================================================================================
AUTHENTICATION
======================================================================================================================
If you want to use the Java or Perl uploader and installed FileManager on a server that requires authentication, you
must set the authUser and authPassword variables in FileManager's configuration file or at runtime.

======================================================================================================================
SMART REFRESH
======================================================================================================================
If two or more users share the same directories and files, usually they don't see the modifications of each other
until they refresh their directory listings manually. FileManager comes with a smart refresh feature that can do this
automagically if any user has made modifications.

However, keep in mind that FileManager enables you to set an individual data directory for each user. In this case,
the smart refresh function won't work properly. There might be other cases where the smart refresh fails, but remember
that you can still refresh your FileManager manually. ;-)

The smart refresh feature is disabled by default, because it puts more load on the server and produces more traffic.
You can enable it anytime in the configuration file or at runtime.

======================================================================================================================
AUDIO SUPPORT
======================================================================================================================
The integrated media player can handle MP3, MP4/AAC, WAV and OGG audio files if your browser supports them via HTML5
audio. For MP3 files, the niftyPlayer serves as a fallback, but it requires a Flash 9+ plugin.

======================================================================================================================
VIDEO SUPPORT
======================================================================================================================
The integrated media player can handle MP4, WebM and OGG video files if your browser supports them via HTML5 video.
For MP4 and FLV files, a free FLV player serves as a fallback, but it requires a Flash 9+ plugin. FileManager can also
view SWF files if your browser has a Flash plugin.

======================================================================================================================
HOOKS
======================================================================================================================
FileManager provides hooks for upload and download, i.e. whenever a file is uploaded or downloaded, a specific URL can
be called by using these hooks. File path, file size and referer IP address (if available) will be sent as parameters
named "file", "size" and "ip". You can use the uploadHook and downloadHook variables in the config file. Your hook
script could look like this:

  <?php
    $file = $_GET['file'];
    $size = $_GET['size'];
    $ip = $_GET['ip'];
    $logFile = '/home/users/gerry/logs/upload_' . date('Ymd') . '.log';

    if($fp = fopen($logFile, 'a')) {
      fwrite($fp, sprintf("%s  %s  %s  %d\n", date('Y-m-d H:i:s'), $ip, $file, $size));
      fclose($fp);
    }
  ?>

Remember, this is just an example. Instead of writing a log file, you could for instance store the information in a
database or send an e-mail etc.

======================================================================================================================
CUSTOM ACTION
======================================================================================================================
You can set a JavaScript function as custom action when a file is clicked. It will also be added to the context menu.
Here's an example for the config file setting:

  customAction = "{caption: 'My custom action', action: 'myCustomAction'}"

The function itself should look like this:

  function myCustomAction(containerId, fileId, fileName) {
    ...
  }

Container ID, file ID and filename will be passed by FileManager. Please note that the filename does not contain a
full path for security reasons and because FileManager can be used with FTP accounts. However, if you set the
variable hideFilePath in the config file to "no", the filename will contain the full path starting in FileManager's
data directory:

  hideFilePath = no

======================================================================================================================
A QUICK NOTE ON ID3 TAGS AND PREVIEW THUMBNAILS
======================================================================================================================
It is only possible to view ID3 tags and preview thumbnails from files of the server's local file system. This is no
problem when FileManager uses the local file system, but in FTP mode these files must first be copied from the FTP
server. This can take quite some time especially when the file size is big and/or there are a lot of files in a
directory. In this case, it is recommended to disable image preview and ID3 tags. This can be done in the
configuration file (variables enableImagePreview and enableId3Tags).

======================================================================================================================
A QUICK NOTE ON FILE DOWNLOAD
======================================================================================================================
When FileManager runs in FTP mode, files must first be transfered to the local system before they can be sent to the
browser. This can take some time especially with big files. To avoid this, FileManager uses the asynchronous FTP mode:
while loading a file from the FTP server, it can start to send it to the browser without having to wait until the
transfer is complete. This works however only on systems with PHP 4.3.0 or higher. If your system runs an older PHP
version, the file must be transfered to the local system completely before download can start.

======================================================================================================================
ABOUT SECURITY
======================================================================================================================
There are some things that you should keep in mind when using this application in order to maintain your server's
security:

- Never give untrusted people access to your FileManager. Implement it into your existing user management or install
  it in a directory that requires authentication or use at least the password protection of FileManager itself.

- If you use FileManager in FTP mode, do not install it on your FTP server. Install it on your webserver instead.

- Do not set FileManagers tmpFilePath variable to a directory within your webservers document root. It is recommended
  to create a dedicated directory for this purpose. Keep in mind that it must be big enough to handle your file
  uploads and FileManagers cache.

- Unless you want to grant unlimited access to all file types, use the allowFileTypes or the hideFileTypes variable
  to limit access to certain file types. These settings also affect file uploads. For instance, if you want to
  disable viewing, uploading and editing of PHP files, add the extension "php" to the hideFileTypes variable.

- FileManager comes with a lot of options (enable/disable file upload, download, editing, etc.) that can be set
  individually for each user (or for all users within the configuration file). Use them wisely.
